# Step One

Note that the gifts are listed in singular: for example, on day 5 the narrator receives “5 golden rings”, but the entry in the dataset for the gift on day 5 simply says “ring”.
In your twelvedays package, navigate to the file pluralize_gift.R in the R folder. You will find some incomplete code for a function called pluralize_gift that takes a gift and returns the appropriate plural.
Complete this function code.

```{r}



```
